# Shopp

Shopp  is a marketplace website aimed for helping users to easily do transactions for daily needs without much hassle.

Shopp is developed with vue.js framework for web pages, and using json-placholder as a temporary back-end API service replacement.
A simple web-service / microservice is planned to be developed as a supplement for Shopp to be a full-stack web app.
